# Gmod-Matrix-Library

## Installation

To install drag the downloaded repo into
 your GarrysMod/garrysmod folder.

The folder should join with the already 
existing lua folder.

## Usage

Using this is very simple as explained below
```
local matrixObject = AMatrix({1,2,3},{4,5,6},{7,8,9})

```
This example makes a 3x3 matrix row one containing 1, 2 and 3, and so on.
